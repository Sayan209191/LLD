// Singleton Pattern : Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
// This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.
// The Singleton pattern is often used for logging, driver objects, caching, thread pools, etc.
// The Singleton pattern can be implemented in various ways, such as using a private constructor, a static instance variable, and a public static method to access the instance.
// The Singleton pattern is a creational design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one single instance.
// It is used when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.
